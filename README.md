##DJI_mobileSDKDocument

This is a third-party DJI mobile SDK document.

I do this because the official one sucks.

Too many _details_ are missing and some functions not available are shown in the official document.

IT SUCKS!

It will be a heavy work and I will upload everything into wiki after finish.
